This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VHDL code: an incorrect handling of the boundary condition in a counter. The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `fixed_counter.vhdl` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from a simple typo or omission in the reset condition of the counter, preventing the counter from resetting properly when it reaches its maximum value. This example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when designing VHDL components.
